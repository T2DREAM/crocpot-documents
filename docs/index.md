# CROCPOT

CROCPOT is genome browser to visualize chromatin studies such as “C” techniques and single cell chromatin accessibility assays.  It builds on Locuszoom.js. The genome browser has a) Long range interaction track b) Fine mapping/credible sets track and c) Gene track.

The key objective of CROCPOT is to associate regulatory elements involved with long range interactions  with causal variant and its target gene that will help understand spatial organization of genome in normal physiology and progression of (co)morbidity; as well as help prioritize expensive and time consuming functional assays.
